                  Yes.
                  We continuously monitor exchange rates, and let merchants charge a markup on these prices.
                  Just like any other product, you have to charge a competitive price if you want to get business.
                  CoinSafe transparently displays your price markup to customers, so they can see exactly what they're paying.

                  That said, providing instant bitcoin in person provides a lot of benefits and so it can command retail pricing.
                  Your customers don't have to have a bank account (or link it to a third party exchange) nor wait several days for their fiat transactions to process.
                  Cash is instantaneous.

                  If you want to sell bitcoin to customers (for cash), CoinSafe has to have a way to send the funds once the transaction is complete, so for those businesses we do this via API.
                  The way this works is that you grant us API access to your
                  <a href="{{ coinbase_url }}">Coinbase</a>,
                  <a href="{{ blockchain_url }}">blockchain.info</a>, or
                  <a href="{{ bitstamp_url }}">Bitstamp</a> wallet.
                  For security, we always recommend keeping low balances on third party bitcoin sites.
                  Remember that you always have absolute power to unlink a third party wallet from CoinSafe by revoking the credential.

                  If all you want to do is buy bitcoin from customers (with the cash in your cash register), then all CoinSafe needs is a valid bitcoin address for customers to send your funds to.
                  That can be any address and we won't even know who holds the private key or what software/service you used to generated that address.

                  You can, but we strongly recommend against it.
                  Besides the transactions fees they charge, there is a very high risk of chargeback.
                  Someone could use a stolen credit card (or use their own card and later claim it was stolen) and then your payment processor might take that money back from you weeks later.
                  Remember that bitcoin transactions are irreversible, so if that happens you would have lost both the money and the bitcoin.
                  Yikes!

                  In order to uniquely identify each bitcoin transaction,
                  we generate a new bitcoin address every time a customer sends bitcoin to your business.
                  That way, we're able to know for sure who sent you that bitcoin.
                  We forward these transactions to your destination address automatically,
                  and there is no fee to you at all
                  (we cover the bitcoin network fee when forwarding the transaction).
                  As always, you can verify this on the bitcoin blockchain for yourself!

                  Usually, our automated system forwards the bitcoin immediately,
                  but sometimes there can be a slight delay.
                  We're working on improving this.
                  If your transaction is delayed, please don't hesitate to

                  No transaction has ever been lost,
                  but sometimes our automated system can fall slightly behind.

                  We display prices very transparently so you know exactly what price you're getting and what percentage markup it is from the major exchanges.
                  Plus, you can easily shop around between different businesses on CoinSafe to find the ones with the best price.
                  Bitcoin in person is always more expensive than online exchanges because you're getting bitcoin immediately (no multiple business day waiting periods) and without having to have a bank account (or link it to a third party).
                  A good baseline for comparing prices is <a href="{{ lb_url }}">localbitcoins.com</a>.
