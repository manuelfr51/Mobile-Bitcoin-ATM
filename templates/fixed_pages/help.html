                  The app is designed to be used by someone who has no idea what bitcoin is.

                  The app will also monitor the bitcoin network and notify the cashier when it is safe to pay out cash to a customer (if buying bitcoin).

                    Customers just show up at your store when they want to buy or sell bitcoin.

                    You don't have to worry about your cashiers running away with all of your bitcoins, double-spend attacks, if a bitcoin address is valid, managing private keys, etc.

                  If you want to sell bitcoin to customers (for cash), CoinSafe has to have a way to send the funds once the transaction is complete, so for those businesses we do this via API.
                  The way this works is that you grant us API access to your
                  <a href="{{ coinbase_url }}">Coinbase</a>,
                  <a href="{{ blockchain_url }}">blockchain.info</a>, or

                  For security, we always recommend keeping low balances on third party bitcoin sites.
                  Remember that you always have absolute power to unlink a third party wallet from CoinSafe by revoking the credential.

                  We encrypt all information while in transit to our servers and store credentials encrypted in our database as well.
                  For security, we always recommend keeping low balances on third party bitcoin sites.
                  For larger amounts of bitcoin, we recommend cold storage using
                  <a href="{{ electrum_url }}">Electrum</a> or
                  <a href="{{ armory_url }}">Armory</a>.
                  Remember that you always have absolute power to unlink a third party wallet from CoinSafe by revoking the credential.

                  Selling bitcoin is similar to selling any other product in that you need to have it in stock before you can sell it to potential customers.
                  The difference with bitcoin is that the value of that inventory can fluctuate wildly.
                  Over the long-term the volatility has tended upwards more than downards, but there's no guarantee that will continue, and that fact is little consolation when bitcoin falls 10% in a single day
                  (which has happened several times).

                  In order to uniquely identify each bitcoin transaction,

                  We forward these transactions to your destination address automatically,
                  and there is no fee to you at all
                  (we cover the bitcoin network fee when forwarding the transaction).

                  Contrary to popular belief, all bitcoin transactions require a very small fee in order to process in a reasonable amount of time.
                  Currently, bitcoin's standard transaction fee is approximately 0.0001 BTC (0.1 mBTC).
                  You can read more about this
                  <a href="{{ tx_fee_url }}">here</a>.

                  When you are buying bitcoin with cash, this means that the store will pay the associated transaction fee so that you receive the exact amount of bitcoin you were quoted.
                  CoinSafe will handle this case automatically.
                  In the event both the customer and the store are using Coinbase, Coinbase can sends the funds
                  <a href="{{ off_chain_url }}">off the blockchain</a>
                  which has no transaction fees.
                  This will happen automatically if the customer puts in an email address to send bitcoin to.

                  When you are selling bitcoin for cash, this means that you have to pay a sufficient fee for your transaction to be processed by the bitcoin network (just like any other bitcoin transaction).
                  The exchange rate is calculated using the amount the store <b>received</b> (the amount after the bitcoin network fee).
                  Your wallet software should handle fees for you automatically, but please note that a store cannot give you cash for your bitcoin until they have received your bitcoin.
                  If you use a non-standard fee that is too low, it's possible your transaction will take many hours to be confirmed by the network (or in extreme cases never be confirmed by the bitcoin network).
                  Our software automatically notifies the store to not release any cash until your transaction is confirmed by the bitcoin network.
                  In other words, save yourself a lot of headache by paying the standard fee on your bitcoin transactions to be sure they are processed by the bitcoin network (and in a reasonable amount of time).

                  We feel this is the de facto standard in bitcoin transactions and the most fair solution for all parties.

                  Not currently, but we'd like to get there one day.
                  One issue is that the web wallet API's are less developed for altcoins vs bitcoin, this will hopefully improve over time.
