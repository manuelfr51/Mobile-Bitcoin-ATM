                  If you want to sell bitcoin to customers (for cash), CoinSafe has to have a way to send the funds once the transaction is complete, so we do this via API.
                  The way this works is that you grant us access to your
                  <a href="{{ coinbase_url }}">Coinbase</a>,
                  <a href="{{ blockchain_url }}">blockchain.info</a>, or
                  <a href="{{ bitstamp_url }}">Bitstamp</a> wallet.
                  For security, we always recommend keeping low balances on third party bitcoin sites.
                  Remember that you always have absolute power to unlink a third party wallet from CoinSafe by revoking the credential.

                  If all you want to do is buy bitcoin from customers (with the cash in your cash register), then all CoinSafe needs is a valid bitcoin address for customers to send your funds to.
                  That can be any address and we won't even know who holds the private key or what software or service you used to generated it.

                  Besides the transactions fees they charge, there is a very high risk of chargeback.
                  Someone could use a stolen credit card (or use their own card and later claim it was stolen) and then your payment processor might take that money back from you weeks later.
