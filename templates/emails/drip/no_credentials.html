Hi {% firstof salutation 'there' %},
<br /><br />
Thanks for trying out CoinSafe.
<br /><br />
I noticed you stopped on the last step of the signup process: linking your online wallet to CoinSafe via API.
We need this so that when customers come in to buy bitcoin at {{ store_name }}, our app is able to relay the order to your wallet.
We currently support Coinbase, blockchain.info and Bitstamp wallets and if you don't have one of those the site will help you create one.
<br /><br />
To link your wallet so that you can sell bitcoin to customers, please click this link:<br />

Best,
<br /><br />

P.S. If you have any feedback on how we can make CoinSafe better for you, please let me know. Thanks!
