Hi {% firstof salutation 'there' %},
<br /><br />
Thanks for using CoinSafe.
<br /><br />
Unfotunately, the API credentials from {{ api_name }} that you gave to CoinSafe are no longer valid.
Did you disable them?
In order to sell bitcoin to customers at {{ store_name }}, CoinSafe needs API access to your wallet.
<br /><br />
To update your API credentials, please click the following link:<br />

<br /><br />
We currently support Coinbase, blockchain.info and Bitstamp wallets.
<br /><br />
If you have any feedback on how we can make CoinSafe better for you, please let me know.
<br /><br />
Best,
<br /><br />
Michael
