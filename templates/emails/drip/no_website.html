Hi {% firstof salutation 'there' %},
<br /><br />
Thanks for using CoinSafe.
<br /><br />
We've created a business profile for you at
<a href="{{ BASE_URL }}{{ profile_uri }}">{{ BASE_URL }}{{ profile_uri }}</a>
but we don't have a website we can include on your profile.
<br /><br />
If you have a website, you can add it by clicking on this link:<br />
<a href="{{ BASE_URL }}{{ add_website_url }}">{{ BASE_URL }}{{ add_website_url }}</a>
<br /><br />
You can also include a website and your business hours.
Just like everything else on CoinSafe, this is 100% free.
<br /><br />
If you have any feedback on how we can make CoinSafe better for you, please let me know.
<br /><br />
Best,
<br /><br />
Michael
