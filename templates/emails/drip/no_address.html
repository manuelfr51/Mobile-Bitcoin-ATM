Hi {% firstof salutation 'there' %},
<br /><br />
Thanks for trying out CoinSafe.
<br /><br />
We'd love to send you new business, but unfortunately we can't include {{ store_name }} on our map because we don't know where it is.
<br /><br />
To add your address, please click this link:<br />
<a href="{{ BASE_URL }}{{ profile_edit_uri }}">{{ BASE_URL }}{{ profile_edit_uri }}</a>
<br /><br />
As an added benefit, when businesses choose to publish their address information we also syndicate it to several other bitcoin sites as well.
<br /><br />
If you prefer, you can just respond to this email with your full business address and we'll take care of it for you.
<br /><br />
Best,
<br /><br />
Michael

P.S. If you have any feedback on how we can make CoinSafe better for you, please let me know. Thanks!
