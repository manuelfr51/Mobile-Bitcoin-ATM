        <h3>For Merchants</h3>
        <p>
          CloseCoin makes it easy for owners of any store to <b>buy bitcoin for cash</b>.
          Some of our happiest customers are money changers, restaurants, hostels, convenience stores, and gas stations.
          It works great anywhere there is a cash register, an internet connection, and a desire to buy bitcoin at the best prices.
          It's kind of like an ATM, only instead of using expensive hardware, we use a simple app and the cash register that's already in your store.
        </p>

        <p>Benefits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Set Your Own Prices</b>.
            Since your business has regular hours and pays out in cash, you get rewarded with better prices.
            It's a much better experience than messaging someone back and forth to meetup at a coffee shop or in a dark alley.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Get Your Money to a Safer Location</b>.
            Every time your cashier reaches into the cash register to pay a customer for their bitcoin, money leaves the premises.
            The address that recieves the bitcoin can be kept anywhere you like: in your safe, at your home, or even in another country.
            Moving cash into bitcoins can minimize theft and reduce robberies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Sell or Spend Your Bitcoin Immediately</b>.
            As soon as you recieve the bitcoin it's yours to sell or spend however you like.
            If you don't want to hold bitcoin, you can set your prices so that you're able to sell it right away for a profit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Very Easy to Use</b>.
            Your employees can buy bitcoin for you without having to know anything about bitcoin.
            You set the price and the app notifies your cashier/employee when it's safe to pay out cash to the customer.
            Our mobile-optimized website requires only an internet connection and works on any smartphone, tablet, or desktop computer.
            No training needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Get New Customers</b>.
            Customers who come to your business and recieve cash for their bitcoin are likely to stick around and spend some of that money.
